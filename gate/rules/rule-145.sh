# Rule 145 — layer_purity (enforcers E194 + E195, kernel Rule G-27)
#
# Authority: docs/governance/rules/rule-G-27.md. One rule, two ADVISORY helpers
# that together encode the adjudicated layer-purity VERDICT: an L0/L1 authority
# surface is a STRUCTURAL boundary document and MUST NOT carry runtime L2
# implementation detail (method call chains, runtime sequences, SQL/RLS/GUC +
# persistence, HTTP status / route-verb / header behaviour, filter ordering,
# wire formats, method signatures, test-class inventories). The detail belongs
# at architecture/docs/L2/ + the contract surfaces (docs/contracts/) + the
# generated facts (architecture/facts/generated/). Naming a public SPI as a
# boundary identity, development-view package decomposition, and ArchUnit /
# enforcer citations are DEFENSIBLE and are never reported.
#   * gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py (E194, slug component layer_purity) —
#     reports the self-contradiction: an authority surface that DECLARES it
#     carries no runtime contract / wire / SPI signature yet does (the L0 §0.6
#     vs §0.5.3 / §4 leak the VERDICT names).
#   * gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py (E195, slug component l2_detail_sink) —
#     reports L2 implementation detail left in L0/L1 prose by signal family
#     (sql_persistence / http_runtime / wire_format / method_signature /
#     filter_ordering / test_inventory). A finding can be suppressed in place
#     with an HTML comment `<!-- l2-detail-sink-allow: <reason> -->`.
# Both helpers run CHANGED-FILES-BLOCKING here (`--mode changed-files-blocking`):
# a PR may not ADD or worsen a leak in an L0/L1 document it TOUCHES; pre-existing
# leaks in untouched documents stay advisory (and a still-open dated grandfather
# row tolerates a known, not-yet-migrated leak in either helper). Ratchet:
# advisory -> changed-files-blocking (this rung) -> full-blocking (the terminal
# rung once the whole L0/L1 corpus is clean + every grandfather row retired, per
# ADR-0159 §9). A missing helper fails closed; a missing python interpreter is a
# vacuous pass (Rule G-7 lists WSL as the canonical env).
#
# The changed-file scope is computed once below and shared: check_layer_purity.py
# derives its own changed set from --base; check_l2_detail_sink.py takes the same
# set as explicit --changed args. Base ref = BASE_REF (default origin/main) when
# it resolves, else HEAD (scope collapses to uncommitted + untracked changes —
# the safe minimal scope on a clone without the base ref, never the full corpus).
#
# scope_surfaces: architecture/docs/L0/*.md, architecture/docs/L1/**/*.md, gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py, gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py
