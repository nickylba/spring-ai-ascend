# Rule 89 — self_test_harness_fail_closed_coverage (enforcer E122)
#
# Closes rc7 post-corrective review P1-1: gate/test_architecture_sync_gate.sh
# hardcoded TOTAL=143 + exited 0 when failed=0 regardless of whether
# passed<TOTAL. Rule 89 asserts that the harness (a) fails closed when
# passed != TOTAL, (b) computes TOTAL from a manifest rather than from a
# bare literal, and (c) every rule defined in check_architecture_sync.sh
# has at least one test_rule_<N>_* fixture in the harness.
