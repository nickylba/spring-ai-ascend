# Rule 151 — status_claim_altitude. DO NOT HAND-EDIT — re-run extract_rules.sh to refresh.
# Authority: PR-E5.

# Rule 151 — status_claim_altitude (enforcer E201, kernel Rule G-34)
#
# Authority: ADR-0159 (Progressive Learning Curve and Authority Lanes) §7 (layer
# purity as a lane invariant) + §9 (the enforcement-posture ratchet). One
# CHANGED-FILES-BLOCKING helper that extends the adjudicated layer-purity verdict
# (the "L0/L1 carries L2/code detail" critique is TRUE) to the capability-status
# ledger's allowed_claim field. Per the authority cascade (generated facts > DSL >
# Card/prose) the ledger OUTRANKS the L0/L1 prose Rule G-27 guards, so the same
# altitude verdict applies at least as strongly: an allowed_claim MUST NOT carry
# an L1..L8 leaked category, it should NAME the capability identity + cite its
# ADR/enforcer (D1/D2/D3) and POINT at the detail's home. The helper invents no id
# and no relationship and never outranks a generated fact (cascade: generated
# facts > DSL > Card/prose):
#   * gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py (E201, slug status_claim_altitude) —
#     loads the SHARED leaked-category vocabulary from
#     docs/governance/layer-purity-policy.yaml and IMPORTS the canonical trigger
#     library (TRIGGERS + the _is_d3_enforcer_citation carve-out) from
#     gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py (one verdict, one probe set, three surfaces),
#     walks every allowed_claim value (recording each claim's capability key +
#     source line), and reports a leaked-category trigger not redeemed by a
#     still-open, capability-matched row in the per-surface grandfather list
#     docs/governance/layer-purity-status-ledger-grandfather.yaml. Each grandfather
#     row is CAPABILITY-PRECISE (it pins the ledger capability key it freezes) so a
#     row tolerates exactly one claim and retiring it re-arms the gate on that
#     claim. It does NOT edit the ledger (owned by the status-ledger reconcile
#     step) and does NOT scan the ledger's structural keys (implementation/tests
#     file lists, l0_decision, enforcer rows — the D2 evidence index).
# Runs CHANGED-FILES-BLOCKING here (`--mode changed-files-blocking --base`): a PR
# that edits docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml may not ADD or worsen a
# claim-altitude leak; pre-existing (grandfathered) leaks in an untouched ledger
# stay advisory. This is the Phase-2 rung: advisory -> changed-files-blocking
# (this rung) -> full-blocking (the terminal rung once every allowed_claim is
# altitude-clean and every status-ledger grandfather row is retired; gated by the
# same clean-workspace + fact-byte-identity condition as Rule G-27 under the
# ADR-0159 §9 ratchet). The helper self-derives the in-scope decision from git against --base; base
# ref = BASE_REF (default origin/main) when resolvable, else HEAD. An un-importable
# trigger library, a zero-claim scan, an unknown cited category, or a
# capability-less ledger row is a config error (exit 2) — the gate fails closed
# rather than scan vacuously or with a drifting private probe copy. A missing
# helper fails closed; a missing python interpreter is a vacuous pass (Rule G-7
# lists WSL as canonical).
