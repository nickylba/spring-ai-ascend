# Rule 144 — adr_normalization. DO NOT HAND-EDIT — re-run extract_rules.sh to refresh.
# Authority: PR-E5.

# Rule 144 — adr_normalization (enforcers E192 + E193, kernel Rule G-28)
#
# Authority: ADR-0160 (ADR Governance Model). One rule, two advisory helpers
# that together pin the normalized-ADR review surface:
#   * gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py (E192, slug adr_taxonomy_normalization) —
#     validates each normalized ADR view (docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml)
#     against adr-taxonomy.yaml + adr-governance-policy.yaml: required fields,
#     the closed five-value current_state set, the per-state field invariants,
#     and the per-level decision_type altitude (forbidden lower-altitude leak).
#   * gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py (E193, slug
#     historical_adr_governance) — ledger totality (every raw ADR in adrs.json
#     has a docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml entry) + normalized-view
#     coverage (every accepted ADR has a normalized view).
# The taxonomy helper (E192) runs ADVISORY here: it reports findings but does not
# block. The historical-ADR helper (E193) is BLOCKING: the dedicated
# normalization wave back-filled the ledger + docs/adr/normalized/ to TOTAL
# coverage (every raw ADR in adrs.json has a ledger entry; every accepted ADR has
# a normalized view), so the ledger-totality + normalized-view-coverage assertion
# is the ADR-0160 ratchet's full-blocking rung and an un-entried raw ADR or an
# accepted ADR with no view now fails the gate. The helper-missing branch still
# fails closed; a non-zero helper rc (a vanished apex adrs.json, OR a real
# coverage finding under --mode blocking) is a hard fail. A missing python
# interpreter is a vacuous pass (Rule G-7 lists WSL as the canonical env); a
# missing PyYAML surfaces as the helper's own config error.
