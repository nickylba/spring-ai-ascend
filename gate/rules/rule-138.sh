# Rule 138 — productclaim_placeholder_decreasing (enforcer E186, kernel Rule G-21)
#
# Phase A Wave 5 (advisory at landing). Count of product_claim_placeholder:true
# markers in the corpus MUST decrease monotonically across Phase B cluster
# cycles; reaching zero is the Phase B convergence signal. At landing the
# count is the Phase B backlog baseline; the rule passes vacuously until a
# baseline is recorded.

# field markers (frontmatter/yaml field lines, not prose mentions in meta-rule docs)
# MUST be 0. Reaching 0 was the G-21 convergence signal that promoted G-16/17/18/20
# from advisory to blocking.
