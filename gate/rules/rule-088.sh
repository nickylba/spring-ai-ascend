# Rule 88 — serial_parallel_gate_slug_parity (enforcer E121)
#
# Closes rc7 post-corrective review P0-2: check_parallel.sh silently skipped
# Rules 86-87 because (a) its awk exit pattern was `^# Summary$` (a comment
# header that happened to live between Rule 85 and Rule 86), and (b) its
# header regex required em-dash `—` while Rules 86-87 originally used
# double-dash `--`. Both defects compound: even fixing one would leave the
# other. Rule 88 asserts at gate time that the set of rule headers the
# canonical script defines equals the set the parallel wrapper would extract.
