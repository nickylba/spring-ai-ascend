# Rule 146 — frame_card_consistency (enforcer E196, kernel Rule G-29)
#
# Authority: ADR-0161 (EngineeringFrame as Package-Cluster Anchor + Card-over-DSL).
# One ADVISORY helper that pins the Frame Card to the lowest interpretation tier
# of the ADR-0154 cascade — the card invents NO id and NO relationship and never
# outranks a generated fact:
#   * gate/lib/check_frame_card_consistency.py (E196, slug frame_card_consistency)
#     — for every authored Frame Card (architecture/docs/L1/frames/<frame-id>.md)
#     it checks (1) frontmatter frame_id / owner_module / status / primary_package
#     copy the DSL EngineeringFrame element exactly (the DSL wins); (2) every cited
#     code-symbol/<kebab-fqn>, test/<kebab-fqn>, contract-op/<kebab-op-id> — and any
#     code-symbol/<fqn>#<jvm-method-descriptor> — resolves in
#     architecture/facts/generated/*.json (the method ref against the class fact's
#     public_methods[]); (3) every FunctionPoint (FP-…) the card names is anchored
#     by THIS frame in architecture/features/engineering-frames.dsl, or is declared
#     a participating-frame reference (no invented anchors).
# Runs CHANGED-FILES-BLOCKING here (`--mode changed-files-blocking`): a PR may
# not ADD or WORSEN a card violation in a Frame Card it touches — a CHANGED card
# whose identity drifts from the DSL element, or that cites a non-resolving fact,
# or that invents an anchor, BLOCKS; pre-existing findings on untouched cards stay
# advisory. This is the Phase-2 rung in the ADR-0161 §6 ratchet: advisory ->
# changed-files-blocking (this rung) -> full-blocking (the terminal rung after a
# 14-day soak on a clean corpus + a green ProfileYamlParityTest). The helper
# self-derives the changed-card set from git against --base (same git-deriving
# pattern as check_layer_purity.py / Rule 145 / E194); when git cannot resolve the
# base it falls back to full-corpus validation (a safe superset). Base ref =
# BASE_REF (default origin/main) when resolvable, else HEAD. The frames/ directory
# is greenfield until the pilot card lands; with no authored cards the helper is
# vacuously clean. The instant one card exists, the DSL elements and the generated
# facts MUST be readable or the helper fails closed (exit 2) — a missing authority
# is never an advisory condition, so it is surfaced as a hard fail in every mode.
# A missing helper fails closed; a missing python interpreter is a vacuous pass
# (Rule G-7 lists WSL as canonical).
