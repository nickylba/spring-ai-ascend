# Rule 148 — ai_reading_path (enforcer E198, kernel Rule G-31)
#
# Authority: ADR-0159 (Progressive Learning Curve and Authority Lanes — the
# product-first eight-node entry chain). One ADVISORY helper that checks the
# reading path declared in docs/governance/ai-reading-path.yaml (and its
# human-readable companion docs/onboarding/ai-understanding-path.md) is
# materializable and the entry docs route a reader onto it. The reading-path
# data file invents no id and no relationship — it records the ORDER over the
# lanes; this check asserts none of its own and never outranks a surface it
# points at (cascade: generated facts > DSL > Card/prose):
#   * gate/lib/check_ai_reading_path.py (E198, slug ai_reading_path) — three
#     checks: SURFACE EXISTENCE (every orientation_learning_path surface marked
#     presence: present resolves on disk; planned surfaces may be absent; the
#     companion mirror + every factual_claim_switch.read_before_prose fact file
#     exist), ENTRY-DOC ROUTING (each step-1 repository_entry doc + the always-
#     load docs/governance/SESSION-START-CONTEXT.md references the data file or
#     its companion), YAML<->COMPANION LOCKSTEP (the companion back-references
#     the YAML and carries a heading per declared step). Findings:
#     MISSING-SURFACE / MISSING-COMPANION / MISSING-FACT-FILE / MISSING-MARKER /
#     LOCKSTEP-BROKEN / LOCKSTEP-STEP.
# Runs ADVISORY here (`--mode advisory`): findings are reported to the gate log
# and never block at this rung. Ratchet: advisory (this rung) -> changed-files-
# blocking (a PR may not ADD a finding once it touches the data file / companion /
# an entry doc) -> full-blocking (the terminal rung once the entry-doc corpus has
# migrated from the legacy architecture-first reading path to this product-first
# chain and the path is clean). docs/governance/ai-reading-path.yaml is greenfield-
# vacuous until it is authored; the instant it exists it MUST parse and its
# companion + factual-claim-switch fact files MUST be readable or the helper fails
# closed (exit 2) in every mode — a missing authority is never an advisory
# condition. A missing helper fails closed; a missing python interpreter is a
# vacuous pass (Rule G-7 lists WSL as the canonical env).
