"""Gate check: L2-detail-sink — implementation detail that leaked into L0/L1 prose.

Authority: docs/governance/rules/rule-G-27.md (kernel Rule G-27), enforcer E195,
gate Rule 145 (advisory). Encodes the adjudicated layer-purity VERDICT: an
L0 / L1 architecture document is a STRUCTURAL boundary surface and MUST NOT
carry runtime L2 implementation detail. The detail belongs in
architecture/docs/L2/ (when those land) and the contract surfaces under
docs/contracts/ + the generated facts under architecture/facts/generated/.

This is the *document-prose* analog of Rule G-28's per-ADR altitude control:
G-28 rejects an L2-altitude `decision_type` in an L0/L1 normalized ADR view;
this rule reports L2-altitude *prose* (SQL/RLS/GUC, HTTP status+verb behaviour,
on-wire formats, method signatures + call chains, filter ordering, concrete
test-class inventories) in an L0/L1 ARCHITECTURE / view markdown.

VERDICT split (the keep-list is NOT reported — only the leak-list is):

  DEFENSIBLE (stays at L0/L1, never flagged):
    * naming a public SPI *type* as a boundary identity (a noun: `Orchestrator`,
      `Checkpointer`, `ResilienceContract`);
    * development-view package decomposition (`com.huawei.ascend..`,
      `<module>/src/main/java/..`);
    * citing an ArchUnit / enforcer mechanism (`enforcer E160`, `Rule R-C.e`,
      `*ArchTest`).

  LEAKED (belongs at L2 / contracts, reported here):
    * SQL / RLS / GUC / persistence DDL + semantics;
    * HTTP status code + route-verb + header runtime behaviour;
    * on-wire formats (OTLP, attribute namespaces, envelope field shapes);
    * Java method signatures + call chains (`A.b() -> C.d()`, CAS arg lists);
    * filter / interceptor ordering;
    * concrete test-class inventories used as evidence in L0/L1 prose.

Scope: the L0/L1 authority corpus in BOTH of its renderings —
  * the Markdown rendering: architecture/docs/L0/*.md and
    architecture/docs/L1/**/*.md, EXCLUDING the `_template/` scaffolds
    (placeholder docs, not authority); and
  * the Structurizr authority-view rendering: architecture/views/*.dsl (the
    L0/L1 4+1 views — L0-system-context, L1-development/process/physical/
    scenarios — whose free-text `description` strings became the PRIMARY
    authority for the L0/L1 corpus per ADR-0147..0151).
The VERDICT's leak categories are rendering-agnostic: a status code, a route x
verb, a filter-chain order, or a Run→state transition is leaked L2 detail whether
it sits in `process.md` prose or in the `L1-Process` view `description`. Keying
this helper on the `.md` extension alone left the `.dsl` rendering — the analog
the verdict relies on E195 to cover for SQL/HTTP/wire/method/filter/test-inventory
leaks — structurally unscanned, so both renderings are scanned here. (The
architecture/features/*.dsl FEATURE-registry fragments are a DISTINCT governed
surface registered under `dsl-element-description` / enforcer E202 in
layer-purity-policy.yaml; this helper does NOT scan them — only the L0/L1
authority VIEW DSLs under architecture/views/, which are the `.dsl` twins of the
L0/L1 documents the markdown half already scans.) Fenced code blocks are
scanned too — a `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` inside a fenced "L2 Boundary Contract"
zone is still leaked L2 detail per the VERDICT (a sanctioned *forward-declaration
heading* does not launder the detail it contains). A single finding can be
suppressed in place with an HTML comment on the same line or the line directly
above it:

    <!-- l2-detail-sink-allow: <reason> -->

(mirrors the `secret-allowlist:` inline opt-out convention used by Rule 28c).

Ratchet (mode):
  advisory               -- report every finding to stderr, always exit 0.
  changed-files-blocking -- exit 1 only if a finding lands on a file passed via
                            --changed (a PR may not add/worsen a leak on a file
                            it touches); other findings stay advisory.
  blocking               -- exit 1 if any finding exists (terminal rung, once the
                            L0/L1 corpus has been swept clean).

Usage:
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py                       # advisory
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py --mode blocking

        --mode changed-files-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py --repo /path/to/repo

Exit codes:
    0 -- mode satisfied (advisory always; *-blocking when no blocking finding)
    1 -- a blocking finding under the active mode, OR a fatal config error

# Delegation-pointer guard.
#
# The layer-purity verdict KEEPS, at L0/L1, the DELEGATION of a forbidden
# category to its authoritative home: a sentence that NAMES a category noun
# only to say "this detail lives in <contract/L2/fact>, not here" is the
# OPPOSITE of a leak — it is the boundary doc doing its job. A purely
# topic-anchored regex (e.g. the bare noun "wire shape", "traceparent",
# "filter ordering") cannot tell that delegation pointer from an inlined
# format/ordering leak, so without this guard the cleanup waves' own
# delegation prose trips the scan. Two signals, BOTH required within a small
# neighbourhood (the markdown bullet/sentence a match sits in spans a few
# physical lines), mark a delegation pointer:
#
#   * an explicit DELEGATION cue — a verb/phrase that hands the detail off
#     ("delegated to", "owned downstream", "lives in", "not (re)stated here",
#     "does not carry", "is contract material", "verification material",
#     "governed by", "(authority)", a "Wire shape:" forward-heading); and
#   * a HOME reference — a contract path, an architecture/docs/L2/ path, a
#     generated-fact path, a `*.v1.yaml`, or an `ADR-NNNN` pointer.
#
# An inlined leak (a `SET LOCAL` GUC, an `ON CONFLICT` clause, a concrete
# `gen_ai.*` namespace, a `00-<trace_id>-<span_id>-01` grammar, a numeric
# `@Order`) carries the MECHANISM on the line and is not redeemed by a
# neighbouring pointer; the dated grandfather list remains the sole tolerance
# for any genuinely-leaked-but-not-yet-migrated block.

# Test-inventory D3-enforcer-citation guard (test_inventory family ONLY).
#
# The layer-purity VERDICT KEEPS, at L0/L1, the DEFENSIBLE act of "citing an
# ArchUnit / enforcer as the mechanism" (policy D3). The companion E194 helper
# spares such a citation from its L8 probe via _is_d3_enforcer_citation; E195
# spares the SAME citations so the two gates that encode one verdict do not
# disagree on a defensible enforcer identity.
#
# These shapes are VERDICT-EQUIVALENT to the E194 carve-out, not byte-for-byte
# identical, by necessity: E195 carries one extra positive probe E194 lacks — an
# inline COMMA-RUN of 2+ `*Test`/`*IT`/`*Spec` tokens on a single line (the
# `test_inventory` family's first pattern). E194's L8 probe only fires on an
# inventory STRUCTURE (a markdown table row, a test-leading bullet, or a
# named-test-plus-behaviour-verb clause), so E194 never even matches a bare
# comma-run of enforcer class names — e.g. the L0 §2 module-dependency line
# "... (enforced by ApiCompatibilityTest, RuntimeMustNotDependOnPlatformTest,
# OrchestrationSpiArchTest, ... ArchUnit rules)". E195's comma-run probe DOES
# match that line, so to reach E194's verdict (no finding) E195 needs one more
# spared shape than E194: an explicit ArchUnit-mechanism citation regardless of
# how many enforcer class names it lists. Without it, E195 over-fires a
# D3-defensible ArchUnit citation that E194 (and the verdict) treat as in-layer.
#
# Spared shapes:
#   1. every enumerated test token is an ArchUnit architecture-test (suffix
#      ArchTest / ArchUnitTest / PurityTest) — these ARE enforcers, never a
#      behaviour catalogue;
#   2. the line is an explicit ArchUnit-mechanism citation — it carries the
#      literal "ArchUnit" signal AND is NOT an inventory STRUCTURE (table row /
#      test-leading bullet) — so a "(enforced by X, Y, Z ArchUnit rules)" clause
#      that NAMES its enforcing ArchUnit rules is a mechanism citation regardless
#      of token count (this is the shape E194 never matches but E195's comma-run
#      probe does; it is the line-252 false positive this fix closes);
#   3. a line carrying a mechanism clause ("enforced by ...", "ArchUnit `...`",
#      "(enforcer E<n>)") that enumerates NO behaviour test is a pure
#      enforcer-id citation; and
#   4. a prose constraint that cites its enforcing test(s) via an explicit
#      enforcement / FQN-lock clause (Rule R-C.a), is NOT an inventory STRUCTURE,
#      and names at most _D3_CITATION_MAX_TESTS behaviour tests, is a mechanism
#      citation.
#
# A genuine integration-test INVENTORY — a table of tests, a bullet list of
# tests, or three-plus *IT/*Test BEHAVIOUR tests in one line that does NOT carry
# an ArchUnit-mechanism signal — stays a leak even beside an "enforced by"
# clause. Shape 2 is gated on the literal "ArchUnit" signal precisely so it

# A grandfather row carries a `locus` cell — the smallest in-file anchor as a
# section label plus a line range. E194 (check_layer_purity.py) tolerates a leak
# ONLY when the leak's line falls inside one of the row's enumerated ranges (an
# anchored row), or the row is a deliberately whole-file `row-level pass
# deferred` entry whose locus carries no line number (an anchorless row, which
# falls back to file + category matching). E195 previously matched a row on file
# + category ALONE — the same blunt scope E194 has since shed — so a same-file,
# same-category leak ANYWHERE in a file collapsed under whichever row first
# declared that category for the file, granting tolerance the dated list never
# adjudicated. The verdict is by-authority-surface and MUST be uniform across the
# two gates that implement it, so E195 here parses the SAME `locus` grammar with
# the SAME strict, all-or-nothing rule and anchors its tolerance identically.
#
# A single comma-segment of a clean line spec is a bare line ("360") or a closed
# range ("520-535"). The ^...$ anchors are deliberate — a segment is a line spec
# ONLY when the WHOLE segment is numeric, so a textual fragment such as "3-track"
# (a stray digit inside prose) is NOT mistaken for a range.
