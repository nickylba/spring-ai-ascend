"""Gate check: layer purity — L2/code detail leaked into L0/L1 architecture prose.

Encodes the adjudicated verdict (the "L0/L1 contains L2/code detail" critique is
TRUE) as an executable, three-mode advisory gate. It reads the machine-readable
owns/forbids policy and the dated grandfather allow-list, scans the L0 + L1
architecture documents for leaked-category trigger patterns, and reports any
LEAKED block that is not redeemed by a still-open temporary-violation row.

Two policy surfaces drive this check (both authored separately; this script is
their executable consumer, it invents no id and no relationship and it never
outranks a generated fact):

  * ``docs/governance/layer-purity-policy.yaml`` — the owns/forbids category
    vocabulary. Fixes the closed category set (defensible D1..D3, leaked
    L1..L8), the layers each category is OWNED / FORBIDDEN at, and the
    authoritative home a leaked category must migrate to. Authority: ADR-0159.
  * ``docs/governance/layer-purity-temporary-violations.yaml`` — the closed,
    dated grandfather list. Each row freezes one known, not-yet-migrated leak in
    an L0/L1 document AND declares a per-entry ``sunset_date`` plus a per-entry
    ``locus`` (the smallest in-file anchor — a section label and a line range).
    A leaked block is TOLERATED (reported as a grandfathered advisory, never a
    finding) only when a still-open row matches it on ALL of file, category, AND
    locus — the leak's line number MUST fall inside one of the row's enumerated
    line ranges. A leak that matches a row's file + category but lands OUTSIDE
    every range that row enumerates is NOT that row's adjudicated leak and stays
    a finding. A leak in no row — or one whose ``sunset_date`` has passed (UTC) —
    is a finding. (A row whose ``locus`` carries no parseable line range — a
    deliberately whole-file ``row-level pass deferred`` entry — is anchorless and
    falls back to file + category matching; ``load_policy`` records which rows are
    anchored so the locus invariant stays auditable.)

What this check is NOT. It is not the migration itself, not a rule card, not an
enforcer row, and it does not edit any authority surface. It is a READABLE-
INTERPRETATION classifier over layer prose: a mechanical pattern match cannot
reproduce the scan's per-line semantic judgement, so its trigger library is
deliberately specific (drawn from the verdict's concrete trigger phrases) to keep
false positives low; the policy YAML remains the normative owns/forbids source
where the two disagree, and the dated allow-list remains the sole tolerance
gate.

Scope of the scan. Only ``architecture/docs/L0/**/*.md`` and
``architecture/docs/L1/**/*.md`` are scanned — those are the over-layers a leak
can sit in. ``architecture/docs/L2/`` and ``docs/contracts/`` are never scanned:
L2 OWNS every leaked category (it is the migration home), so detail there is
in-layer by construction. The L1 ``_template/`` skeletons are excluded (they are
placeholder scaffolding, not authored content).

Modes (``--mode``):

  advisory                 Scan every L0/L1 document, print findings +
                           grandfathered notes to stderr, and ALWAYS exit 0.
                           This is the soak posture: the check reports but never
                           blocks. Default until the policy promotes to blocking
                           per ADR-0159 §9.
  changed-files-blocking   Scan only the L0/L1 documents that changed relative to
                           a base ref (``--base``, default ``origin/main``). Exit
                           1 if any CHANGED document carries a non-grandfathered
                           leak; pre-existing leaks in untouched documents do not
                           block. This is the ratchet posture: a PR may not ADD a
                           leak, but is not blocked by debt it did not touch.
  full-blocking            Scan every L0/L1 document; exit 1 on any
                           non-grandfathered leak. This is the terminal posture
                           once the corpus is clean and every grandfather row has
                           been retired.

Usage:
    python3 gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py --mode advisory
    python3 gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py --mode changed-files-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py --mode changed-files-blocking --base origin/main
    python3 gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py --mode full-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py --mode full-blocking --repo /path/to/repo

Exit codes:
    0 — passed (always, in advisory mode); or no in-scope findings in a blocking
        mode
    1 — one or more in-scope, non-grandfathered findings in a blocking mode
        (printed to stderr)
    2 — usage / configuration error (bad mode, unreadable/empty policy file, no
        L0/L1 documents discovered, etc.)
