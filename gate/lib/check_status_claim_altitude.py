"""Gate check: status-claim altitude — L2/code detail leaked into the capability ledger.

Authority: docs/governance/rules/rule-G-34.md (kernel Rule G-34), enforcer E201,
gate Rule 151 (changed-files-blocking). Extends the adjudicated layer-purity
VERDICT (the "L0/L1 carries L2/code detail" critique is TRUE) to the HIGHER-
authority capability-status ledger.

Motivation. The two existing layer-purity helpers scope EXCLUSIVELY to the L0/L1
markdown prose:

  * gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py  (E194) -> architecture/docs/L0/**/*.md +
    architecture/docs/L1/**/*.md
  * gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py (E195) -> the same two roots

But the ``allowed_claim`` strings in docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml are
a free-form narrative field with no altitude guard, and they have organically
accreted exactly the categories the verdict named — SQL / ``ON CONFLICT`` /
``PRIMARY KEY`` (L3), HTTP status codes + route-verbs + wire error tokens (L4),
``@Order`` tie-break + ``Class.getName()`` (L5), ``DROP_OLDEST`` buffer + W3C
``traceparent`` + ``OTLP/HTTP`` (L6), method signatures + ``A.b() -> c`` call
chains (L1/L7), and enumerated ``*IT`` test inventories (L8). Per the authority
cascade (generated facts > DSL > Card/prose) this ledger OUTRANKS the L0/L1
prose, so a leak here is at least as significant as the prose leaks the two
helpers above already gate — yet nothing scanned it. This helper closes that
by-authority-surface gap.

What this check is. A READABLE-INTERPRETATION classifier over the ledger's
``allowed_claim`` strings, the status-ledger analogue of check_layer_purity.py.
It reuses the SAME closed category vocabulary
(docs/governance/layer-purity-policy.yaml: leaked L1..L8) and the SAME closed,
per-entry dated grandfather list
(docs/governance/layer-purity-temporary-violations.yaml) those helpers consume.
It invents no id and no relationship and it never outranks a generated fact —
it reads the policy as the vocabulary and the ledger as the data, and reports a
leaked-category trigger in an ``allowed_claim`` value that is not redeemed by a
still-open grandfather row.

Shared trigger library. The leaked-category trigger probes are IMPORTED
verbatim from gate/lib/check_layer_purity.py (its ``TRIGGERS`` dict + the
``_is_d3_enforcer_citation`` D3 carve-out), so the status ledger is judged by
exactly the same mechanism the L0/L1 prose is — one verdict, one probe set,
three surfaces. If the import fails (the sibling helper is absent), this is a
config error (exit 2): the gate fails closed rather than scan with a private,
drifting copy of the probes.

Scope of the scan. ONLY the ``allowed_claim:`` values of
docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml. The structural ledger keys
(``status``, ``shipped``, ``implementation`` / ``tests`` file lists, the
``l0_decision`` pointer, enforcer-row citations) are NOT scanned: a path to a
``*.sql`` migration under ``implementation:`` or a test FQN under ``tests:`` is
the ledger's development-view evidence index (D2 package decomposition), not a
behavioural claim. Only the prose ``allowed_claim`` narrative — the field that
has no altitude guard and organically leaks — is in scope.

Grandfather rows for this surface. They live in a DEDICATED, per-surface dated
allow-list, docs/governance/layer-purity-status-ledger-grandfather.yaml, with the
SAME row schema and the SAME closed-list discipline as the L0/L1 list
(docs/governance/layer-purity-temporary-violations.yaml) but scoped to this one
surface. A row tolerates a ledger leak when its ``file`` equals
docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml, it cites the leaked category, and its
``sunset_date`` is today-or-later (UTC). Such rows carry ``layer: STATUS-LEDGER``
(a free-form label, distinct from L0/L1).

Why a SEPARATE allow-list rather than appending to the L0/L1 list: the two
surfaces have different owners and different gates (E194/E195 scan the L0/L1
documents; E201 scans this ledger), so a per-surface tolerance file keeps each
gate's allow-list cohesive and avoids cross-surface write contention on one
file. The CATEGORY VOCABULARY stays shared and single-source
(docs/governance/layer-purity-policy.yaml, imported below), so the two surfaces
are judged by one verdict; only the per-surface tolerance rows are split. A
STATUS-LEDGER row is INERT for E194/E195 regardless (those helpers never read
this file), so the split introduces no risk of cross-suppression.

Modes (``--mode``):

  advisory                 Scan every ``allowed_claim`` value, print findings +
                           grandfathered notes to stderr, and ALWAYS exit 0.
                           The soak posture.
  changed-files-blocking   Block only when docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml
                           is itself in the changed set (vs ``--base``, default
                           ``origin/main``): a PR that edits the ledger may not
                           ADD or worsen a claim-altitude leak; pre-existing
                           (grandfathered) leaks stay advisory. When the ledger
                           is untouched, every finding stays advisory. This is
                           the ratchet posture.
  full-blocking            Exit 1 on any non-grandfathered finding. The terminal
                           posture once every ``allowed_claim`` is altitude-clean
                           and every status-ledger grandfather row is retired.

Usage:
    python3 gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py --mode advisory
    python3 gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py --mode changed-files-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py --mode changed-files-blocking --base origin/main
    python3 gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py --mode full-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_status_claim_altitude.py --mode full-blocking --repo /path/to/repo

Exit codes:
    0 — passed (always, in advisory mode); or no in-scope findings in a blocking
        mode
    1 — one or more in-scope, non-grandfathered findings in a blocking mode
    2 — usage / configuration error (bad mode, unreadable/empty policy or ledger,
        un-importable shared trigger library, zero claims discovered, etc.)

      * the row cites the leak's leaked category, and

    The capability match is what makes a row freeze exactly ONE claim: because
    every leak on this surface shares the same ``file``, file+category alone
    would let the first same-category row suppress unrelated claims (and removing
    a cleaned claim's row would not un-suppress its leak while any same-category
    row survived). Pinning the capability key keeps each row's tolerance scoped
    to its own claim, so retiring a row re-arms the gate on that claim if it
    still leaks. The row's ``layer`` is not consulted (the file + capability
    already scope it).
