# `EF-ENGINE-PORT` — Engine Port Frame

## 2. Capability Boundary

> AUTHORED prose. Package names are CITED (they must exist); the lists below are the
> human-readable boundary, not a second registry.

**Can do** — the responsibilities that live inside this frame:

- Declare the neutral Service↔Engine port: a Service drives an engine through
  `EnginePort` (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-engineport`); an engine
  implements it; the two modules never depend on each other.
- Carry the engine-facing execution context as the tenant/session-free supertype of
  `RunContext` — opaque correlation (`runId` / `traceId` / `spanId`) plus the suspend
  capability only (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-executioncontext`).
- Carry the dispatch request as a serializable value naming a capability by reference,
  not by inline behaviour (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-executerequest`
  with `code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-definitionref`).
- Define the streamed execution outcome where suspension and failure are TERMINAL
  events, never exceptions thrown across the boundary
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-agentevent`).
- Advertise engine identity and health to the Service for selection
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-enginedescriptor` via `describe()`),
  and bridge a `DefinitionRef` back to a runnable definition
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-definitionresolver`).

**Cannot do** — explicitly out of scope (handled by another frame or an L2 detail):

- Carry tenant / session / nested-run semantics — those belong to the Service-side
  `RunContext` and the neutral execution model owned by the sibling agent-bus frame
  `EF-ORCHESTRATION-SPI` (`Orchestrator`, `RunContext`, `SuspendSignal`, `Checkpointer`,
  `ExecutorDefinition`, `RunMode`, `TraceContext`).
- Provide any engine realization — the in-process realization (`InProcessEnginePort`)
  and the engine-internal registry are owned by the agent-execution-engine frame
  `EF-ENGINE-REGISTRY`; the networked realizations (`RpcEnginePort`, `A2aEnginePort`)
  and the in-process adapter wiring are the agent-service engine-adapter layer.
- Select or operate a transport — choosing in-process / internal-RPC / A2A by
  deployment form is the Service's adapter responsibility, not the port contract's.
- The over-the-wire suspend/resume checkpoint-token mechanics, the per-form physical
  placement, and the wire field semantics are L2 detail — delegated to the frame's L2
  sink and the contract surface, not restated in this card.

**Owned state** — the data/state this frame is the structural home for:

- No mutable runtime state. The frame is a contract surface: the boundary interface
  (`EnginePort`), its value types (`ExecuteRequest`, `AgentEvent`, `DefinitionRef`,
  `EngineDescriptor`), and the engine-facing `ExecutionContext` supertype.

**External dependencies** — frames / modules this frame is allowed to depend on:

- `java.*` only (plus same-SPI-package siblings). The port returns a
  `java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher` of events; `java.util.concurrent.Flow` is part
  of `java.*` and is allowed under the SPI-purity rule (see section 7).
- The neutral execution model in the same package (`bus.spi.engine`) owned by
  `EF-ORCHESTRATION-SPI` — `ExecutorDefinition` (referenced by `DefinitionResolver`),
  `RunContext` (the Service-side subtype of this frame's `ExecutionContext`).

**Forbidden dependencies** — dependencies the boundary must never take (held by an
ArchUnit enforcer; cite it in section 7):

- `org.springframework.*` and any framework runtime — the SPI is pure Java
  (enforcer `E48`); a Spring import on `bus.spi.engine` is the prohibited shape.
- Any `agent-service` or `agent-execution-engine` production package — the contract is
  owned by no single engine and carries no reverse dependency on its drivers or
  realizations.

**Included / excluded packages** (this frame is a curated slice of a shared package, not a single root):

- In-boundary types (within `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine`): `EnginePort`,
  `ExecutionContext`, `ExecuteRequest`, `AgentEvent` (and its `Finished` / `Failed` /
  `InterruptRequest` / `Kind` members), `DefinitionRef`, `EngineDescriptor`,
  `DefinitionResolver`.
- Excluded (same package, owned by `EF-ORCHESTRATION-SPI`): `Orchestrator`,
  `RunContext`, `SuspendSignal`, `Checkpointer`, `ExecutorDefinition` (and members),
  `RunMode`, `TraceContext`. These are surfaced as same-package collaborators in
  section 5, not as this frame's Type Inventory.

## 3. Type Inventory

> GENERATED — do not hand-edit between the markers. Rendered from
> `architecture/facts/generated/code-symbols.json`, filtered to the frame's in-boundary

> this region and overwrites it on every re-render.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: type-inventory -->
| Type | Kind | Fact ID |
|---|---|---|
| _(deferred — this `design_only` frame declares no `saa.primaryPackage`, so the generator emits no fact-cited inventory; the in-boundary types are a curated slice of the shared `bus.spi.engine` package and are cited in the authored Capability Boundary and Contracts sections until the frame is promoted with a package root or an `engineering-frames.json` per-frame type set lands.)_ |  |  |
<!-- END GENERATED: type-inventory -->

## 4. Internal Collaboration

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: internal-collaboration -->
| From | Relationship | To |
|---|---|---|
| _(deferred — see the Type-Inventory note above; with no generator-emitted in-boundary type set there is no fact-derived collaboration table for this `design_only` frame.)_ |  |  |
<!-- END GENERATED: internal-collaboration -->

## 5. Contracts

> AUTHORED prose. The communication contracts this frame exposes or consumes. Cite each
> contract operation by its fact ID and each SPI by its package identity.
> Wire-field and over-the-wire mechanics are L2 — link down, do not inline.

**Exposed SPI / public surface (boundary identity):**

- `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.EnginePort`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-engineport`) — the neutral port the
  Service drives and the engine implements: a streaming `execute` plus `describe`.
- `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.ExecutionContext`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-executioncontext`) — the engine-facing
  context with no tenant/session method (the supertype of `RunContext`).
- `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.ExecuteRequest`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-executerequest`) and
  `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.DefinitionRef`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-definitionref`) — the serializable
  request and the by-name capability reference it carries.
- `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.AgentEvent`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-agentevent`) — the streamed outcome
  event type (exactly one TERMINAL event per execution leg).
- `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.EngineDescriptor`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-enginedescriptor`) and
  `com.huawei.ascend.bus.spi.engine.DefinitionResolver`
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-definitionresolver`) — the engine
  self-description and the reference↔definition bridge.

**Contract surfaces (schema contracts):**

| Contract | Fact ID | Contract source |
|---|---|---|
| EnginePort neutral wire shape (boundary statement, operations, deployment forms, suspend/resume) | `contract-yaml/engine-port` | `docs/contracts/engine-port.v1.yaml` |

> `engine-port.v1.yaml` is a YAML *schema* surface (`fact_kind: schema`, `status: design_only`,
> `authority: ADR-0158`), not an OpenAPI/AsyncAPI operation; the public HTTP `contract-op/*`
> operations belong to the agent-service edge frames, not to this frame.

**Consumed contracts** (surfaces this frame depends on, owned by another frame):

- The neutral execution model in the same `bus.spi.engine` package, owned by
  `EF-ORCHESTRATION-SPI` — `ExecutorDefinition` (the definition a `DefinitionRef`
  resolves to) and `RunContext` (the Service-side subtype of this frame's
  `ExecutionContext`).

## 6. FunctionPoint Mapping

> AUTHORED prose over the frame's DSL `anchors` edges. Lists ONLY FunctionPoints the DSL
> anchors to this frame. A `design_only` frame may anchor zero FunctionPoints — and this
> one does.

This frame anchors **zero** FunctionPoints. In `architecture/features/engineering-frames.dsl`
the only edges incident on `efEnginePort` are the structural `genModule_agent_bus -> efEnginePort`
(`contains`) edge and the value-axis `featEngineDispatchAndHooks -> efEnginePort` (`traverses`)
edge; there is no `anchors` edge. As a boundary contract whose concrete behaviour is realized by
other frames (`EF-ENGINE-REGISTRY` in-process; the agent-service engine-adapter layer over the
wire), this frame carries the contract surface, and the executable behaviour is anchored by the
frames that realize and drive it. The shipped-frame anchor rule (section 7) therefore does not
apply to it while it is `design_only`.

## 7. Verification

> AUTHORED prose. The constraints, ArchUnit enforcers, and gate rules that hold this
> boundary. Cite each enforcer / rule as a structural identifier (not version metadata).

**Constraints / enforcers holding the boundary:**

- Enforcer `E48` (`SpiPurityGeneralizedArchTest`) — asserts any
  `com.huawei.ascend..spi..` package (which includes `bus.spi.engine`) does not depend
  on Spring, the platform, reference impls, Micrometer, or OpenTelemetry; the port stays
  pure Java.
- Rule `G-22` (enforcer `E187`, `accepted_adr_frame_map_coherence`) — asserts that while
  ADR-0158 is `accepted`, the frame map declares `EF-ENGINE-PORT` (owner `agent-bus`)
  and `EF-ORCHESTRATION-SPI` (owner `agent-bus`) under a `genModule_agent_bus` contains
  edge, so this frame's identity cannot drift from the accepted ADR.
- Rule `G-24` (enforcer `E189`, `old_orchestration_spi_package_ban`) — asserts no active
  authority surface names the `engine.orchestration.spi` package (re-homed by ADR-0158) as
  the current home of this contract; `bus.spi.engine` is the single current home.
- Rule `G-29` (enforcer `E196`, `frame_card_consistency`) — asserts this card copies the
  DSL identity exactly and that every fact ID it cites resolves in
  `architecture/facts/generated/*.json`.

**Tests anchoring the behaviour** (fact-cited):

> One `test/<kebab-fqn>` fact ID per bullet, each with a one-line behaviour gloss — the
> sanctioned per-anchor citation form (parallel to the method-descriptor citation), not an
> embedded test catalogue. A free-standing enumeration of three-plus tests with their
> asserted behaviour crammed into one line would be an L8 test-class-inventory leak (Rule
> G-27 flags it); the exhaustive list lives in `architecture/facts/generated/tests.json`.

- `test/com-huawei-ascend-bus-spi-engine-orchestrationspiarchtest` — `bus.spi.engine` has
  no Spring and no platform dependency (SPI purity of the boundary package).
- `test/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-orchestration-engineportsignaturenoregressiontest`
  — `execute` is the streaming signature, `describe` returns an `EngineDescriptor`, and the
  old value-returning `execute` is gone.
- `test/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-orchestration-enginefacingcontexthasnotenantsessiontest`
  — `ExecutionContext` declares no tenant or session method (the neutral-context invariant).
- `test/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-orchestration-boundarydispatchusesdefinitionrefnotlambdatest`
  — `ExecuteRequest` carries a `DefinitionRef` and no inline `ExecutorDefinition`, is
  serializable, and `EnginePort.execute` takes the wire request.

> **Missing proof before promotion to `shipped`:** the DSL declares no
> `saa.primaryPackage`, so this frame has no frame-owned Java home and no generator-emitted
> fact-cited Type Inventory; it anchors zero FunctionPoints; and it owns no engine
> realization (the realizations live in `EF-ENGINE-REGISTRY` and the agent-service
> engine-adapter layer). Until a frame-owned package root (or an `engineering-frames.json`
> per-frame type set) and at least one anchored FunctionPoint land, this frame stays
> `design_only` and carries no generated Type Inventory.
