# ADR-0055 — Permit `agent-platform → agent-runtime`; Forbid the Reverse

- Status: Superseded by ADR-0078 (this ADR supersedes ADR-0026).
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Authority: L1 plan `l1-modular-russell` decision D1, user-approved.
- Current authority: [ADR-0078](0078-agent-service-consolidation.yaml) (normalized view [`normalized/ADR-0078.yaml`](normalized/ADR-0078.yaml)). ADR-0078 folded `agent-platform` and `agent-runtime` into the single `agent-service` Maven module, so the two-module **Maven dependency direction** this ADR codified no longer exists as a module boundary; the platform→runtime asymmetry survives only as the intra-module sub-package layering invariant (`service.runtime` MUST NOT import `service.platform`). The decision below is history, citeable for context only, not as current authority.

> **Altitude quarantine (layer-purity).** What this ADR DECIDED is a **D2 module-dependency-direction** identity: `agent-platform` MAY depend on `agent-runtime` (Maven + source level) and the reverse is forbidden. That structural direction is the whole decision. The Context paragraph below motivates it with an **illustrative** runtime handoff — a `POST /v1/runs` route token (`L4-http-status-route-verb` altitude) and an `Orchestrator.submit(...)` method-call token (`L1-method-call-chain` altitude) — used only to explain WHY a platform→runtime edge is needed; neither was ever the runtime contract through this ADR. The route's authority is the OpenAPI surface (facts `contract-op/createrun`, sourced from `docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml`) with its L2 readable expansion [`architecture/docs/L2/run-http-contract/`](../../architecture/docs/L2/run-http-contract/); the method-call chain's authority is the generated code-symbol facts and the L2 orchestration-submit sink. Read the illustrative route + method below as quarantined narrative justification, reduced to the structural dependency-direction identity — not as live wire/call authority. (Because ADR-0078 supersedes this ADR, the structural direction itself is now intra-module sub-package layering, not a Maven edge.)

## Context

L0 shipped with **zero** direct imports between `agent-platform` and `agent-runtime`. ADR-0026 (W0-era) anticipated this would be resolved at W1 by extracting an `agent-platform-contracts` module: a pure-Java module holding shared types (`Run`, `RunContext`, `Orchestrator`, etc.) that both modules would depend on.

At L1 planning the architect guidance (`docs/plans/2026-05-13-l1-architecture-design-guidance.en.md` §7.3, §15.5) ruled the contracts-module extraction out: *"Introduce `agent-platform-contracts` only when a real platform-runtime handoff needs shared DTOs or value types. Do not create it as speculative architecture scaffolding."*

L1 introduces a real handoff: `POST /v1/runs` requires `RunController` (in `agent-platform`) to call `Orchestrator.submit(...)` (in `agent-runtime`). Without either a contracts module or a direct dependency, the handoff cannot be expressed. *(Per the altitude quarantine above, the `POST /v1/runs` route and the `Orchestrator.submit(...)` call are illustrative justification only; the structural identity this establishes is simply that an `agent-platform → agent-runtime` dependency edge exists. The route + method authority lives on the OpenAPI surface and the generated code-symbol facts, not in this ADR.)*

The choice between the two options reduces to:

- **Option A — Extract `agent-platform-contracts` (W1 target per ADR-0026)**: pure-Java module holding shared types; both modules depend on it.
- **Option B — Allow `agent-platform → agent-runtime` direct dependency**: smaller change; `agent-runtime`'s public types (`runs.*`, `orchestration.spi.*`) become directly callable from the HTTP layer.

Option A creates a third module for a handful of types. Option B keeps the module count at 4 and uses existing public types — matching the guidance's "don't extract speculatively" principle.

The negative invariant — **`agent-runtime` MUST NOT depend on `agent-platform`** — is preserved under both options. The platform's request-scoped concerns (`TenantContextHolder`, JWT filters, idempotency store) MUST stay invisible to runtime code, because runtime code runs in non-request contexts (timer-driven resumes, async orchestration) where those concerns are undefined.

## Decision

**`agent-platform` MAY depend on `agent-runtime` (Maven level, source level).**

**`agent-runtime` MUST NOT depend on `agent-platform` (Maven level, source level).**

The previously-symmetric Gate Rule D-6 is amended to enforce only the runtime→platform direction. A new ArchUnit test (`RuntimeMustNotDependOnPlatformTest`) generalises Rule R-C.e from the single `TenantContextHolder` class to the whole `com.huawei.ascend.service.platform..` package.

The `agent-platform-contracts` module is **not** introduced at L1. If a future wave (W2+) identifies a real handoff that benefits from a third module, that decision lands in its own ADR.

## Enforcement

Rule R-C.a (Code-as-Contract) requires every constraint to have an executable enforcer. This ADR's invariants are backed by:

- **E1** — `gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` Rule D-6: agent-service/pom.xml does not depend on agent-platform.
- **E2** — `RuntimeMustNotDependOnPlatformTest` (ArchUnit): no class under `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime..` imports `com.huawei.ascend.service.platform..`.
- **E4** — `HttpEdgeMustNotImportMemorySpiTest` (ArchUnit): `agent-platform` does not import `runtime.memory.spi..`.
- **E27** — `module_count_invariant`: root pom declares exactly 9 modules (bumped from 4 to 9 by the 2026-05-17 six-module materialization PR; canonical count now lives in `docs/governance/architecture-status.yaml#repository_counts.total_reactor_modules` and is data-driven cross-checked by Rule 64).

Self-tests in `gate/test_architecture_sync_gate.sh` exercise both PASS (no offending dep) and FAIL (offending dep injected) cases.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Smallest possible L1 module change (zero new modules).
- HTTP handoff uses existing public types — no boilerplate translation layer.
- The L1 invariant ("HTTP edge never imports memory SPI") is explicit and tested.
- Negative invariant on runtime→platform direction is generalised, not weakened.

### Negative

- `agent-platform` transitively pulls `agent-runtime`'s deps (Spring AI starters, Temporal SDK, pgvector). Acceptable: both modules ship as Spring Boot apps and the deps are needed anyway.
- If a future wave needs to extract a contracts module, the refactor is invasive (every `agent-platform → agent-runtime` import becomes `agent-platform → agent-platform-contracts`). Mitigated by keeping the imported surface narrow (`runs.*`, `orchestration.spi.*` only).

### Neutral

- ADR-0026 is marked **Superseded by ADR-0055**. The historical context remains useful.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A — Extract `agent-platform-contracts` at L1

Rejected: architect guidance §7.3 explicitly forbids speculative extraction. The handoff surface at L1 is narrow (`Run`, `RunStatus`, `Orchestrator`, a few records) — not enough to justify a third module.

### Option C — Defer the run handoff itself

Rejected: defeats L1's purpose. The W1 HTTP API is the headline deliverable of L1.

## §16 Review Checklist
