# ADR Classification — Level × View

This table is the canonical per-ADR `level:` + `view:` classification consumed by `gate/migrate_adrs_to_yaml.py` and `gate/build_architecture_graph.sh`. It is hand-maintained because the classification reflects intent (does this ADR govern a cross-module principle, or a per-module contract, or a feature detail?), not surface syntax.

When a new ADR is added, its row MUST be added here in the same PR (Rule G-1 sub-clause .a, Gate Rule R-G).

## Levels

- **L0** — cross-module governing principle / meta-rule about how the corpus is itself governed.
- **L1** — domain-or-module-level contract (per agent-platform / agent-runtime / a vertical / a cross-cutting filter chain).
- **L2** — feature-specific technical detail.

## Views

- **logical** — domain model, entity / status semantics, contract surface.
- **development** — package structure, dependency direction, naming, SPI purity.
- **process** — concurrency, async lifecycle, state machine, posture / boot guard, request-filter chain, body-of-request lifetime.
- **physical** — deployment topology, sandbox / OS-level isolation, storage placement.
- **scenarios** — cross-view golden-link; meta-governance about the corpus itself.

## Cutover procedure

1. Review and refine `level:`/`view:` rows above (especially 0001–0018, which were assigned defaults).
2. Run `python3 gate/migrate_adrs_to_yaml.py --write` from the repo root. This emits sibling `.yaml` files for every `.md` ADR.
3. For each emitted YAML, hand-populate `supersedes:` / `extends:` / `relates_to:` by reading the original prose citations. (The script leaves these empty so no false edges are inserted.)
4. Run `bash gate/build_architecture_graph.sh` and fix any unresolved edges.
5. `git rm docs/adr/*.md` (leaves `docs/adr/*.yaml` and this README).
6. Update `docs/adr/README.md` to regenerate from the YAML corpus.
7. Run `bash gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` — Gate Rules 37, 38, 40 must pass.
